# UNIVERSAL CUSTOM DISCORD RPC!! HECK YEAH!!

A simple Python script that gives you a custom Discord Rich Presence for literally any app or game. I originally built this to get Ship of Harkinian (Ocarina of Time PC port) showing up on my Discord profile on Arch Linux, but I’ve tweaked it so it works for **Windows, Mac, Linux** and probably **BSD** too! 

### Features
* **Lightweight** - virtually 0 cpu
* **Smart** - only shows up when the game is open
* **Universal** - it works for any program
* **Persistent** - it will work even if discord crashes or closes
* **Easy to use**

## SET UP!!

1. **Install Dependencies:** Install python, pypresence and psutil :p
2. **Get an ID:** If there isn't an application for your program then make an application but if there is just lookup the application id: [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
3. **Configure:** Copy the application id into the `.py` script (btw the whole thing is annotated)
4. **(Optional):** Upload icons to that application on the discord website

## How to use

Then run the program and open your app, if you set it up right things should work!

> I like to make mine an executable but you can just run `python discord_rpc.py` too
